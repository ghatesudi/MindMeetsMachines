# C04 deep-vein thrombosis

**Develop a diagnosis concept set for *Acute Proximal Lower-Extremity Deep-Vein Thrombosis (LE-DVT)*—an incident, clinically acute thrombus in popliteal or more proximal deep veins—to support a cancer-associated thrombosis phenotype. The set must represent current, incident proximal LE-DVT (including incidental events that are treated), expressed with explicit site/acuity terminology. Use this to address comparative safety/effectiveness and burden over 0–365 days (e.g., bleeding, recurrence) among adults with active malignancy receiving therapeutic anticoagulation, including generalized comparisons such as *Drug A* vs *Drug B*.**

# Clinical Scope

* **Disease entity:** Acute thrombus in proximal lower-extremity deep veins—popliteal, femoral (common/superficial), deep femoral, iliac, or IVC—typically presenting with unilateral leg swelling, pain, warmth; may be incidentally detected on imaging in oncology care. Objective confirmation usually by compression duplex ultrasound or CT/MR venography.  
* **Temporality:** **Incident/current** event only; remote or resolved events are out of scope.  
* **Severity & acuity:** All acute severities are in scope, including iliofemoral extension and IVC involvement when proximal LE origin is explicit.  
* **Manifestations:** Accept terms that **explicitly link** the diagnosis to proximal LE location (e.g., “iliofemoral DVT,” “femoral vein thrombosis,” “popliteal DVT”); laterality may be unspecified.  
* **Etiology:** Any cause (including cancer-associated or postoperative) provided location is proximal LE; pregnancy-related VTE is excluded.  
* **Population:** Adults with active malignancy are the primary use context.  
* **Ambiguity tolerance:** Prefer **site-specific proximal** terms; avoid broad/unspecified venous thrombosis labels unless clearly proximal LE.

# Boundaries & Assumptions

* Exclude **history/chronic/sequela** terms, **status-post**, **rule-out/suspected**, surveillance, or administrative/problem-list qualifiers without an acute diagnosis.  
* Exclude **isolated distal calf DVT**, **upper-extremity DVT**, **superficial thrombophlebitis**, **pulmonary embolism** (handled separately), and **pregnancy-related VTE**.  
* Restrict to **explicit acute diagnostic terms** for proximal LE-DVT; do not substitute imaging/procedure or medication proxies within this concept set.

# Related or differential conditions that may coexist but are not sufficient for inclusion

* Distal calf DVT (peroneal/posterior/anterior tibial, muscular veins).  
* Superficial vein thrombosis (e.g., great saphenous).  
* Chronic post-thrombotic changes; lymphedema; venous insufficiency; cellulitis; Baker cyst.  
* Upper-extremity DVT; pulmonary embolism.
