# C05 Ovarian Cancer

**Our objective is to define a concept set representing active, primary epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum. This set must capture a confirmed diagnosis of malignant disease, not a history of it or a borderline condition. It will serve as the foundational disease definition for subsequent phenotype algorithms used in comparative effectiveness and health outcomes research focused on women with relapsed or refractory disease, ensuring we begin with a high-fidelity patient population.**

# Clinical Scope

* **Disease entity**: The scope is primary epithelial malignancy originating in the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum. This includes all major epithelial histologies: high-grade serous, low-grade serous, endometrioid, clear cell, mucinous, malignant Brenner tumors, and carcinosarcoma (MMMT) when primary to these sites. Diagnosis is typically confirmed via tissue pathology.  
* **Temporality**: The scope is restricted to current, active malignant disease.  
* **Severity & acuity**: All stages and grades of invasive epithelial carcinoma are included.  
* **Etiology**: Only primary malignancies of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum are in scope.  
* **Ambiguity tolerance**: We require specific terminology indicating a primary epithelial malignancy of the specified gynecologic sites. Generic terms for peritoneal cancer are insufficient due to the high risk of representing secondary disease.

# Boundaries & Assumptions

* Documentation reflecting only a past history of disease, screening, suspected or rule-out status, or remission without evidence of active disease is explicitly excluded.  
* The concept set is restricted to explicit diagnostic terms for the condition.

# Related or differential conditions that may coexist but are not sufficient for inclusion

* Non-epithelial ovarian tumors, such as germ-cell tumors (e.g., dysgerminoma) or sex-cord stromal tumors (e.g., granulosa cell).  
* Borderline or low malignant potential epithelial tumors of the ovary.  
* Secondary malignant neoplasms metastatic to the ovary or peritoneum from other primary sites, such as gastrointestinal primaries (Krukenberg tumors).
