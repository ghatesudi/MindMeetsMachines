# C01 Systemic Lupus Erythematosus

Build a concept set for *Systemic Lupus Erythematosus — systemic form* that captures current, clinically active disease for use in a prevalent SLE phenotype supporting comparative-effectiveness work. The concept set must reflect explicit systemic SLE diagnoses (including “SLE with organ involvement”) and avoid ambiguous or historical labels. The motivating question is generalized as: among patients with prevalent systemic SLE, what are 12-month outcomes (e.g., steroid burden, inadequate response) after initiating *Drug A* versus *Drug B*?

# Clinical Scope

* **Disease entity:** Chronic, systemic autoimmune disease with relapsing–remitting course; typical features include mucocutaneous, musculoskeletal, hematologic, renal, neuropsychiatric, and serosal involvement, with immunologic abnormalities consistent with SLE.  
* **Temporality:** **Prevalent/current** systemic SLE only; historical disease alone is out of scope.  
* **Severity & acuity:** All severities—from mild to life-threatening organ disease—are in scope when the diagnosis explicitly denotes systemic SLE.  
* **Manifestations:** Include when organ/system involvement is **explicitly linked** to SLE (e.g., “SLE with nephritis,” “SLE with cerebritis”). Organ-specific terms without SLE linkage are insufficient.  
* **Etiology:** Primary systemic SLE only; exclude drug-induced and neonatal forms.  
* **Population:** Age-inclusive (pediatric and adult). Pregnancy does not restrict inclusion if systemic SLE is diagnosed.  
* **Ambiguity tolerance:** Prefer **explicit, specific terminology** (“systemic lupus erythematosus,” “SLE with …”) over broad or ambiguous “lupus” labels.

# Boundaries & Assumptions

* Exclude documentation of **past history**, **screening**, **suspected/rule-out**, or **remission-only** status.  
* Exclude purely administrative/problem-status qualifiers without a concurrent systemic SLE diagnosis.  
* Restrict to **explicit diagnostic terms** that unambiguously denote systemic SLE.  
* Exclude cutaneous-only lupus, drug-induced lupus, neonatal lupus, and isolated antiphospholipid/lupus anticoagulant without SLE.  
* Exclude non-SLE entities containing “lupus” (e.g., lupus vulgaris).

# Related or differential conditions that may coexist but are not sufficient for inclusion

* Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (discoid, subacute cutaneous) without systemic SLE.  
* Drug-induced lupus; neonatal lupus.  
* Antiphospholipid syndrome without SLE.  
* Undifferentiated or mixed connective tissue disease; systemic sclerosis; dermatomyositis/polymyositis; Sjögren’s syndrome; rheumatoid arthritis.  
* Organ-specific diagnoses (e.g., nephritis, serositis, cytopenias, CNS vasculitis) **without explicit SLE linkage**.  
* Non-SLE “lupus” terms (e.g., lupus vulgaris).

# Synonyms

* Systemic lupus erythematosus  
* SLE  
* Systemic lupus  
* Disseminated lupus erythematosus (historic)  
* SLE with organ involvement (e.g., “SLE with nephritis”)
