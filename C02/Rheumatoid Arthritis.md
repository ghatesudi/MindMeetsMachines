# C02 Rheumatoid Arthritis

Build a diagnosis concept set for *Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)—adult, systemic form* that captures prevalent, established disease with high clinical specificity to underpin a broader phenotype (including a D2T RA branch). Include explicit RA diagnoses and RA-linked extra-articular manifestations; avoid ambiguous or non-specific labels. This concept set will support comparative characterization and effectiveness/burden analyses (e.g., D2T RA vs non-D2T RA; or Drug A vs Drug B) in 12-month follow-up.

# Clinical Scope

* **Disease entity:** Chronic, systemic autoimmune inflammatory polyarthritis characterized by persistent, often symmetrical synovitis of diarthrodial joints with risk of cartilage loss, bone erosions, and deformity; commonly presents with insidious polyarticular pain, swelling, and morning stiffness; may include autoantibodies (RF/ACPA) and flares/remission over a chronic course.  
* **Temporality:** **Prevalent/established** RA present at or before index. “History of RA” is in scope **only when it reflects an ongoing established diagnosis**, not a resolved remote event.  
* **Severity & acuity:** Include all severities (mild to severe) and states (active disease or remission) when the diagnosis explicitly denotes RA.  
* **Manifestations:** Include extra-articular disease **when explicitly linked to RA** (e.g., rheumatoid lung disease, rheumatoid vasculitis, Felty’s syndrome). Organ/system terms without an RA link are insufficient.  
* **Etiology:** Autoimmune inflammatory arthritis; include seropositive and seronegative RA.  
* **Population:** **Adults**; pediatric entities (JIA, juvenile RA, Still’s disease) are out of scope.  
* **Ambiguity tolerance:** Prefer **explicit, specific RA terminology** over broad/unspecified labels (e.g., avoid “arthritis NOS,” “inflammatory arthritis,” or isolated “arthralgia”).

# Boundaries & Assumptions

* Exclude visits documenting **screening**, **rule-out/suspected** status, or purely administrative/problem qualifiers without an explicit RA diagnosis.  
* Accept remission terminology **only** when tied to an established RA diagnosis.  
* Restrict to diagnostic terms that unambiguously denote RA; prioritize specificity to minimize contamination from other inflammatory arthropathies.  
* Exclude pediatric arthritis entities and non-inflammatory arthropathies.

# Related or differential conditions that may coexist but are not sufficient for inclusion

* Psoriatic arthritis; ankylosing spondylitis and other spondyloarthropathies; reactive and enteropathic arthritis.  
* Systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic sclerosis; Sjögren’s; dermatomyositis/polymyositis; undifferentiated/mixed connective tissue disease.  
* Gout; calcium pyrophosphate disease (pseudogout/CPPD).  
* Polymyalgia rheumatica.  
* Osteoarthritis.  
* Non-specific terms (arthralgia, “arthritis” NOS) and organ-specific conditions **without explicit RA linkage**.

# Synonyms

* Rheumatoid arthritis  
* Rheumatoid polyarthritis  
* Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis  
* Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis  
* Felty’s syndrome (RA with splenomegaly and neutropenia)
