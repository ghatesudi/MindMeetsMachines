# C07 **Systemic Sclerosis**

This concept set will identify Systemic Sclerosis (SSc; systemic scleroderma)—a systemic, not localized, autoimmune fibrosing vasculopathy—to support a phenotype used in comparative-effectiveness analyses (e.g., Drug A vs Drug B) for outcomes in SSc, including SSc-associated ILD and progressive pulmonary fibrosis. The set must represent current, active systemic disease using explicit diagnostic terminology, sufficient to anchor an incident SSc cohort and downstream organ-specific analyses.

# Clinical Scope

* **Disease entity:** Chronic autoimmune disorder with immune dysregulation, microvasculopathy, and progressive fibrosis affecting skin and internal organs (lungs, GI tract, heart, kidneys). Diagnosis is clinical; 2013 ACR/EULAR elements include proximal skin thickening (sufficient criterion), Raynaud’s phenomenon, digital ischemic lesions, telangiectasias, abnormal nailfold capillaries, PAH and/or ILD, and SSc-specific autoantibodies (anti–Scl-70, anticentromere, anti–RNA polymerase III).  
* **Subtypes:** Diffuse cutaneous (dcSSc), limited cutaneous (lcSSc, includes CREST), and SSc sine scleroderma (internal organ involvement without skin thickening).  
* **Temporality:** **Incident** SSc; capture established, current disease at/after index.  
* **Severity & acuity:** Include full spectrum from mild to life-threatening, acute manifestations and chronic progression.  
* **Manifestations:** Multisystem involvement is in scope **when explicitly linked to SSc** (e.g., SSc-ILD, SSc-PAH).  
* **Etiology:** Autoimmune/idiopathic SSc only.  
* **Population:** Adults primarily; include juvenile systemic sclerosis if present. Prefer precise, explicit terms over broad or ambiguous labels.

# Boundaries & Assumptions

* Exclude documentation of **history of**, **screening**, **suspected/rule-out**, **pending**, **remission-only**, or purely administrative qualifiers.  
* Restrict to **explicit diagnostic terms** that denote systemic sclerosis; organ findings alone are insufficient without an SSc link.

# Related or differential conditions that may coexist but are not sufficient for inclusion

* **Localized scleroderma (critical exclusion):** morphea (generalized/plaque/guttate), linear scleroderma, en coup de sabre.  
* **Mimics/fibrosing conditions:** eosinophilic fasciitis, scleredema, scleromyxedema, nephrogenic systemic fibrosis.  
* **Induced scleroderma:** drug-induced (e.g., bleomycin, taxanes) or environmental/occupational (silica, vinyl chloride, toxic oil).  
* **Other/overlap:** GVHD with sclerodermatous features; MCTD or UCTD unless “systemic sclerosis” is explicitly stated; isolated Raynaud’s, acrosclerosis, or sclerodactyly.

# Synonyms

* Systemic scleroderma; Progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS); CREST syndrome (limited cutaneous SSc); SSc.
