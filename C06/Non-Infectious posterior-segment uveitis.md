# C06 Posterior Uveitis

Develop a diagnosis concept set for *active, non-infectious posterior-segment uveitis*—encompassing intermediate uveitis, posterior uveitis, and panuveitis—to support a phenotype used in comparative effectiveness work (e.g., Drug A vs Drug B). The set must capture current, clinically active disease at or immediately preceding initiation of systemic therapy. Precision takes precedence: include explicit posterior-segment uveitis terms and named non-infectious entities when the uveitic nature is clear; avoid ambiguous labels. The research aim is to compare time to treatment failure and steroid dependence after treatment start.

# Clinical Scope

* Disease entity: immune-mediated, non-infectious inflammation of the uveal tract with posterior-segment involvement (intermediate, posterior, panuveitis); may be chronic/recurrent and sight-threatening.  
* Typical presentation: vitreous cells/haze; “snowballs/snowbanking” (intermediate); chorioretinitis/retinitis; retinal vasculitis; optic disc edema. Imaging may show CME on OCT and leakage/vasculitis on angiography.  
* Temporality: prevalent/current active episodes at or immediately before systemic treatment start.  
* Severity/acuity: all severities in scope, including steroid-dependent or refractory disease.  
* Manifestations: posterior-segment findings must be clearly linked to uveitis.  
* Etiology: non-infectious (idiopathic or associated with systemic autoimmune/autoinflammatory disease) when the uveitic diagnosis is explicit.  
* Population: age-inclusive; ophthalmology-diagnosed preferred.  
* Ambiguity tolerance: favor anatomically specific, explicit terms; avoid “unspecified uveitis” lacking posterior anatomy.

# Boundaries & Assumptions

* Exclude documentation of past history, screening encounters, “rule-out/suspected,” remission-only, or administrative qualifiers.  
* Restrict to explicit diagnostic terms naming non-infectious posterior-segment uveitis.  
* Exclude infectious uveitis and masquerade syndromes.  
* Exclude anterior-only uveitis, traumatic/post-procedural uveitis, and isolated complications without an explicit uveitis diagnosis.

# Related or differential conditions that may coexist but are not sufficient for inclusion

* Infectious posterior uveitides (toxoplasma; HSV/VZV/CMV; tuberculosis; syphilis).  
* Intraocular lymphoma and other masquerade entities.  
* Anterior uveitis, episcleritis/scleritis, non-inflammatory mimics.  
* Organ-specific findings such as cystoid macular edema or retinal vasculitis without an explicit uveitis diagnosis.

# Synonyms

* Intermediate uveitis; pars planitis; posterior uveitis; panuveitis; posterior cyclitis.  
* Retinochoroiditis/choroiditis (non-infectious context).  
* Named non-infectious posterior/panuveitis entities: birdshot chorioretinopathy; Vogt–Koyanagi–Harada–associated uveitis; sympathetic ophthalmia; sarcoid-associated uveitis; Behçet-associated posterior uveitis.
