# C03 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)

Construct a diagnosis concept set for *Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)*—macular thickening and/or intra-/sub-retinal fluid explicitly attributable to diabetes mellitus—to support a treatment-anchored phenotype. The set must capture *current, clinically active* DME near treatment initiation and avoid ambiguous or historical labels. Use this to address: among adults with diabetes initiating DME therapy, what are 12–18-month treatment patterns and burden for *Drug A* vs *Drug B* (e.g., injection frequency, persistence, switching)?

# Clinical Scope

* **Disease entity:** Diabetes-attributable macular edema characterized by retinal thickening and/or intra/sub-retinal fluid at the macula; typical presentation includes blurred vision and metamorphopsia. Clinical confirmation commonly relies on OCT; management includes intravitreal anti-VEGF, corticosteroid implants, and/or focal/grid laser.  
* **Temporality:** **Prevalent/current** disease at or near the treatment index; historical or resolved disease alone is out of scope.  
* **Severity & acuity:** All severities (center-involved or non-center-involved; unilateral or bilateral) are in scope when DME is explicitly diagnosed.  
* **Manifestations:** Include terms that **explicitly link** macular edema to diabetes (e.g., “diabetic retinopathy **with** macular edema”); laterality or “center-involved” modifiers may be present but are not required.  
* **Etiology:** Restrict to DME **due to type 1 or type 2 diabetes**; exclude macular edema from other causes (post-operative, uveitic, retinal vein occlusion, neovascular AMD, myopic/PCV CNV).  
* **Population:** Adults with diabetes; pediatric use is not targeted by this concept set.  
* **Ambiguity tolerance:** Favor **explicit, specific** diabetic-attribution terminology; exclude generic “macular edema” or legacy terms unless unambiguously diabetic.

# Boundaries & Assumptions

* Exclude documentation of **history of**, **screening for**, **suspected/rule-out**, or **resolved** DME.  
* Exclude **unspecified macular edema**, cystoid macular edema without diabetic attribution, and **diabetic retinopathy without** mention of macular edema.  
* Limit to **explicit diagnostic terms** denoting *current* DME caused by diabetes; do not substitute related retinal disease codes or visit/imaging logic.

# Related or differential conditions that may coexist but are not sufficient for inclusion

* Neovascular age-related macular degeneration.  
* Retinal vein occlusions (CRVO/BRVO) with macular edema.  
* Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; myopic choroidal neovascularization.  
* Post-operative cystoid macular edema (Irvine–Gass); uveitic cystoid macular edema.  
* **Unspecified macular edema** without diabetic linkage.  
* Diabetic retinopathy **without** macular edema.

# Synonyms

* Diabetic macular edema (DME)  
* Diabetic retinopathy **with** macular edema  
* Diabetic maculopathy with macular edema  
* Center-involved DME (CI-DME)  
* Clinically significant macular edema (CSME) — **when explicitly diabetic**
