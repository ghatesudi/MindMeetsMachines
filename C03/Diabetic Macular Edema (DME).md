# [C03 Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/MindMeetsMachines/tree/main/C03)

Construct a diagnosis concept set for *Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)*—macular thickening and/or intra-/sub-retinal fluid explicitly attributable to diabetes mellitus—to support a treatment-anchored phenotype. The set must capture *current, clinically active* DME.

This concept set will support an observational study that aims to answer the following research question:

Among adult diabetic patients on drug-a anti-diabetic medication what is the incidence rate of developing *Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)*.

The concept set will be used in the phenotype of the outcome *Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)*.

**Clinical case definition:** Retinal thickening and/or intra/sub-retinal fluid in the macula due to diabetes mellitus (type 1 or 2). Diagnostic criteria is confirmed through OCT evidence of macular thickening and/or intra/sub-retinal fluid.

**Presentation & Course:** Blurred vision, metamorphopsia; may be asymptomatic early. Often chronic, managed with anti-VEGF, steroids, and/or focal/grid laser; treat-and-extend or PRN patterns are common.

**Differential Diagnoses (Conditions to be distinguished and not considered inclusive)**

* Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD)  
* Retinal vein occlusions (CRVO/BRVO) with macular edema  
* Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; myopic CNV  
* Post-operative cystoid macular edema (Irvine–Gass)  
* Uveitic cystoid macular edema  
* Unspecified macular edema without diabetic attribution

**Common Treatments/Management:** Intravitreal anti-VEGF; intravitreal/periocular corticosteroids (dexamethasone, fluocinolone implants); focal/grid macular laser; serial OCT monitoring.

**Clinical Scope and Granularity**

* **Disease entity:** Diabetes-attributable macular edema characterized by retinal thickening and/or intra/sub-retinal fluid at the macula; typical presentation includes blurred vision and metamorphopsia. Clinical confirmation commonly relies on OCT; management includes intravitreal anti-VEGF, corticosteroid implants, and/or focal/grid laser.  
* **Temporality:** Incidence and **current** disease; historical or resolved disease alone is out of scope.  
* **Severity & acuity:** All severities (center-involved or non-center-involved; unilateral or bilateral) are in scope when DME is explicitly diagnosed.  
* **Manifestations:** Diabetic retinopathy that is explicitly linked to macular edema. Both laterality or “center-involved” are within scope.  
* **Etiology:** Restrict to DME due to type 1 or type 2 diabetes; macular edema from other causes (post-operative, uveitic, retinal vein occlusion, neovascular AMD, myopic/PCV CNV) are not within scope.  
* **Population:** Adults with diabetes; pediatric use is not targeted by this concept set.

**Related, differential conditions or comorbidities that are not sufficient for inclusion**

* Neovascular age-related macular degeneration.  
* Retinal vein occlusions (CRVO/BRVO) with macular edema.  
* Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; myopic choroidal neovascularization.  
* Post-operative cystoid macular edema (Irvine–Gass); uveitic cystoid macular edema.  
* Unspecified macular edema without diabetic linkage.  
* Diabetic retinopathy without macular edema.

**Synonyms**

* Diabetic macular edema (DME)  
* Diabetic retinopathy with macular edema  
* Diabetic maculopathy with macular edema/ “with macular edema” modifiers  
* Center-involved DME (CI-DME)  
* Clinically significant macular edema (CSME) — when explicitly diabetic
