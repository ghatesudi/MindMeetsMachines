# The "Minds Meet Machines" (MMM) Challenge

**A Multi-Arm, Blinded, Comparative Study Evaluating Human Expert versus Generative AI-Driven Workflows for Phenotype Concept Set Selection**

**Version 1.0.0** (October 3, 2025)

## Study Overview

The "Minds Meet Machines" (MMM) Challenge is a methodological study comparing the performance of traditional human-led workflows against new Generative AI (GenAI) approaches for creating phenotype concept sets. These concept sets are essential for identifying patient populations in observational health research.

This study aims to rigorously evaluate the accuracy and completeness of GenAI-driven methods compared to a consensus-based human benchmark. The entire evaluation is conducted on de-identified outputs, ensuring participant privacy.

**Official Title:** A Multi-Arm, Blinded, Comparative Study Evaluating Human Expert versus Generative AI-Driven Workflows for Phenotype Concept Set Selection
**Trial Acronym:** MMM
**Sponsor-Assigned ID:** OHDSI-GLOBAL-PhenotypeWorkgroup-20251009

## Key Objectives

### Primary Objective
- To evaluate the performance (accuracy and completeness) of GenAI approaches versus a rigorous, consensus-based human workflow for translating standardized clinical descriptions into phenotype concept sets.

### Secondary Objectives
- Quantify inter-human variability before reconciliation.
- Analyze the clinical impact of findings using prevalence-weighted metrics.
- Conduct a secondary analysis using selected source vocabularies (e.g., ICD-10-CM).

## Study Design

- **Study Type:** Methodological evaluation of de-identified outputs.
- **Model:** Parallel Assignment (multi-arm comparative design).
- **Masking:** Single-blind (Outcomes Assessor). Adjudicators are blinded to the source of each concept set (Human vs. AI).
- **Allocation:** Participants self-select or are grouped by independent honest brokers.
- **Arms:**
    - **Arm 1 (Human Workflow):** A "Split and Reconcile" model using standard OHDSI tools (ATLAS, PHOEBE, ATHENA).
    - **Arm 2 (Generative AI Workflows):** Fully automated GenAI pipelines with no human-in-the-loop editing.
