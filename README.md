> [This message is also the notice of release of the concept sets for the challenge - https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/MindMeetsMachines/ (AI Participants have till 1 hour after the end of the symposium of October 8th 2025 to submit their submission. You can email me directly).

**Dear OHDSI Colleagues and Registered Participants,**

This is a workshop and not a systematic research.

We are excited about the enthusiastic response to the "Minds Meet Machines" challenge planned for the upcoming OHDSI Symposium by the Phenotype Development and Evaluation Workgroup on October 9th 8am to 12pm (walk-in registration welcome, this will be educational and group discussions).

In our planning discussions, we focused on ensuring this activity can proceed effectively at the symposium. To do this, the session will be conducted strictly as a **hands-on workshop exercise**, rather than a formal research study (originally proposed to be protocol driven human subjects research study). We will not be performing systematic data collection for generalizable knowledge (e.g., no formal pre-workshop surveys or audio recording of deliberations) - this is now not a systematic research activity.

The core objective remains fully intact: we will conduct a collaborative learning activity aimed at comparing concept sets generated by human teams versus those from autonomous AI pipelines.

This post details the logistics and the final run-of-show for the workshop.

### Prerequisites for Participants (IMPORTANT)

To maximize our limited time together, please ensure the following:

1.  **Bring Your Laptop:** This is essential. Participants in the human workflow arm must bring their own laptops to access the workshop's dedicated ATLAS environment.
2.  **Review Materials (Homework):** The target phenotypes and clinical descriptions are specified [ohdsi-studies/MindMeetsMachines](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/MindMeetsMachines), please review them. It is crucial that you review these materials **before** the workshop, as time during the session will be dedicated to building and analyzing, not reading background information.
3.  **Vocabulary Standardization:** To ensure consistency, all work (Human and AI) will utilize a standardized OMOP Vocabulary version released [August 27th 2025](https://github.com/OHDSI/Vocabulary-v5.0/releases/tag/v20250827_1756288395.000000).

### Workshop Agenda (Run of Show)

The workshop runs from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM.

**7:00 AM - 8:00 AM: Setup and Preparation (Workshop Leads/Volunteers - @gdravida09 , @Gowtham_Rao , @Azza_Shoaibi , @Jack_Murphy )**

Leads and volunteers will finalize room setup, A/V checks, and ensure the dedicated ATLAS instance is operational. Empty "shell" concept sets will be pre-loaded into ATLAS to standardize name submissions.

**8:00 AM - 8:30 AM: Welcome, Instructions, and Logistics [Azza Shoaibi, Gowtham Rao]**

  * **8:00 - 8:15: Introduction:** Welcome, overview of the agenda, and instructions for the exercise.
  * **8:15 - 8:30: Group Formation and Logistics:**
      * **Skill Identification:** Upon entry, participants will select a colored sticky note representing their experience level with ATLAS/phenotyping (e.g., Expert, Familiar, or Observer/New) and place it on their badge (color stickers). Clinical experts and investigators will have their own colors, and are not allowed to be part of the concept set creation group. Clinical experts will lead the adjudication group.
      * **Table Selection:** Tables will be labeled with a specific phenotype. Please choose a table. Online participants will be grouped in one conference call.
      * **Balancing Expertise:** We will ask participants to briefly shuffle to ensure a mix of experience levels at each table (aiming to sit next to someone with a different color sticker - collaboratively learning with volunteers).

**8:30 AM - 9:45 AM: Phase 1 - Human Concept Set Creation (Split and Reconcile)**

The concept set building begins.

1.  **Split:** Each table will split into two subgroups.
2.  **Independent Creation:** Subgroups will work independently in the provided ATLAS instance to populate their assigned concept set shells. (The use of GenAI tools is prohibited in this phase). Each subgroup will create 1 concept set.
3.  **Reconcile:** The subgroups will convene to negotiate and submit one final, consolidated concept set for their table.

<!-- end list -->

  * **9:45 AM: Pencils Down.** The ATLAS instance will be locked.

**9:45 AM - 10:15 AM: The Transition (Data Sprint and Presentations)**

  * **Break:** Participants can take a brief coffee break.
  * **AI Presentations:** Short (approx. 10-minute) presentations from AI methodology leads (e.g., Darya, Joel).
  * **Data Sprint (Backend):** Simultaneously, the technical team will extract the human-generated concept sets, merge them with the pre-submitted AI sets, blind all sources, and generate the adjudication lists ("The Delta").

**10:15 AM - 11:30 AM: Phase 2 - Blinded Adjudication**

1.  **Reshuffling:** Participants will return and must sit at a table different from the phenotype they worked on in Phase 1.
2.  **Adjudication Process:** The designated Clinical Expert for that phenotype will lead the adjudication at their table using a blinded interface. The group will review "The Delta"â€”the list of concepts where disagreement existed among the human and AI arms.
3.  **Prioritization:** The adjudication list will be prioritized to focus first on concepts with mid-level disagreement and high prevalence.
4.  **Decision Making:** The group will discuss the concepts, but the Clinical Expert makes the final inclusion/exclusion decisions. A volunteer will be present to help ensure decisions remain consistent with the provided clinical input documents [ohdsi-studies/MindMeetsMachines](https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/MindMeetsMachines).

**11:30 AM - 12:00 PM: Wrap-up and The Reveal**

  * **11:30 AM:** Adjudication stops. Any additional adjudication will be carried offline.
  * **Results Discussion:** We will present preliminary results, focusing on pairwise overlap metrics. This will include both raw concept overlap and prevalence-weighted overlap (showing the impact on patient populations captured by the overlapping concepts).

We look forward to a productive and insightful workshop. Thank you for your participation\!

Sincerely,

Gowtham A Rao, Azza A Shoaibi, and the Minds Meet Machines Team
